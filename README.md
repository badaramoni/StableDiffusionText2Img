## Project Overview

The project utilizes Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art model that converts text descriptions into high-quality images. It incorporates:
- **CLIP**: To understand and process the text input for better alignment with the generated images.
- **U-Net Encoder/Decoder**: For the image generation pipeline ensuring detailed and accurate imagery.

## Features

- Generate images from text.
- Integration of robust models like CLIP and U-Net.
- Scalable architecture for further enhancements.
